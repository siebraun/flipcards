        <p>
          Ready to party? The pagan celebration of the winter solstice is known
          as Yule, and it’s one of the oldest winter celebrations in the world.
          It simultaneously celebrates the shortest day of the year, midwinter,
          the return of the Sun, and a festival of rebirth. This year, it occurs
          from December 21, 2021, to January 1, 2022.

          Physically, Yule marks the point at which the Sun begins to return to
          us—aka when the days begin to lengthen again. But the winter solstice
          is the darkest day of the year, so Yule is both a time of reflection
          and celebration.
        </p>

        <p>
          This festival has been on the calendar for centuries. In pagan times,
          the druids would give mistletoe, which commonly grows on oak trees, as
          a blessing to symbolize life. The Yule log also dates back to this
          time. The Celts thought the Sun stood still for 12 days during the
          darkest time of the year, and they would light logs to keep away evil
          and welcome in good fortune. If you think all this sounds kind of
          familiar, that’s because when Christianity spread throughout Europe,
          many pagan winter solstice traditions were incorporated into Christmas
          celebrations.

          The Winter Solstice is a celebration of renewal and reflection. At
          this time, we respect the underworld, ward off spirits, and honor the
          rebirth of the sun.
        </p>

        <p>
          As the outside world is at its darkest and the nights at their
          longest, Yule gives space for our inner realms to expand and come
          forth. It is a time to bring in new visions and ideas, make
          resolutions for the year ahead, and dream bold dreams.
